# Fast SR-UNet

Fork of <https://github.com/fede-vaccaro/fast-sr-unet>.

This repository contains the implementation of [1]. It is an architecture comprised with a GAN-based training procedure
for obtaining a fast neural network which enable better bitrate performances respect to the H.265 codec for the same
quality, or better quality at the same bitrate.

#### Requirements:

See `install.sh` script.

#### The dataset:

See the original readme.

#### Training the model:

See the original readme.
